Project for modeling acquistion of phonotactics.

Standardizing klattbet across the stimuli and the Pearl corpus:  
* "j" in Pearl is a typo and should be "J"  
* "x" in stimuli converted to "^"
* "X" in stimuli converted to "R"
* We do not collapse "a" "c", in stimuli everything is represented using "c".
* Do we need to replace @ with A to deal with wordseg algorithms?
* No "o" in stimuli, but appears in corpus

All of these were hand checked by comparing the two systems with the help of arpabet for the stimuli and the transcription for Pearl stimuli
