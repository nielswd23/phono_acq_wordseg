Project for modeling acquistion of phonotactics.

Standardizing klattbet across the stimuli and the Pearl corpus:  
"j" in Pearl is a typo and should be "J"  
"^" from Pearl is "x" in stimuli. So we will just convert instances of "^" to "x" in the Pearl corpus.  
"R" in pearl is "X" in stimuli. Converted "R" to "X" in Pearl corpus.  
"a" for pearl is just not in stimuli because they merge it with "c." We decided to collapse the "a" "c" distinction in the Pearl corpus. Technically, this produces some incorrect transcriptions (even speakers of a dialect that don't make this distinction will produce different sounds in different contexts), but this was a simplifying decision.  
"o" from Pearl doesn't appear in the stimuli simply because they did not test this sound  
and we can get rid of the special character that they both share, "@", by replacing it with "A"  

All of these were hand checked by comparing the two systems with the help of arpabet for the stimuli and the transcription for Pearl stimuli
